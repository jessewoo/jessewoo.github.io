            <p>Jesse impressed me from the first day he joined the frontend team. I worked with him at American
              Specialty Health, and although we never together on the same Scrum team, we did collaborate as fellow
              frontend engineers to advance some frontend initiatives across several teams. Jesse picks up new concepts
              very quickly and took to a framework that he had no prior knowledge of like a fish to water. What stood
              out most to me about Jesse was how conscientious he was of every aspect of a project, always bringing
              insightful questions to the table in kickoff meetings. Instead of merely focusing on the "what", he drove
              to understand the "why" in projects as well. This is a mark that Jesse has left on me, and a practice that
              I have carried forward into my career. Jesse is extremely humble and very easy to work with. I would
              recommend him for any position and believe that he would be a huge asset to any team he works with.</p>

            <p>I have worked together with Jesse at the RCSB Protein Data Bank for several years. During that time Jesse
              completely re-design the user experience of our website and did the technical implementation of it. He has
              a clear vision, provides excellent proposals for a design and then can execute and implement the design.
              The final pages looked exactly as planned. Under his guidance we greatly simplified the user experience
              and gained a much more contemporary and responsive look and feel that works across multiple devices and
              screen sizes. Jesse is a great team player and you can count on him on getting the job done!</p>

            <p>I worked with and managed Jesse during his time at Ampush. Jesse was a hard worker who was an integral
              part of the media buying team and primarily responsible for building out much of our search and contextual
              campaign portfolio. He was a true team player who wore many different hats during his time at Ampush,
              always being flexible with what he worked on to try to help out where he was needed most.</p>

            <p>I had the opportunity to work closely with Jesse and always appreciated his willingness to jump in on any
              task. He was able to understand a complex code base and help improve and refactor the existing code and
              add new, valuable features. In the time I worked with him I found him to be a very hard worker, a good
              person to bounce ideas off of, and eager to learn new technologies. He is kind, professional, and an all
              around great person.</p>

            <p>During my time at RCSB-PDB, I was an intern that Jesse was my mentor. I could tell Jesse was a hard
              worker, despite taking on the additional workload to support and direct two interns, he was still
              presenting his work complete and finished. I am thankful for his expertise in HTML, CSS, JavaScript &
              JQuery as he answered many of my questions and provided constructive feedback to my prototypes. Jesse's
              guidance was shown greatly as after the internship I successfully landed my first job using all that I
              learned. I enjoyed working with Jesse, he cares for his work but also cares about the people there. I
              would definitely recommend Jesse!</p>
